I'm Austin Lanari. By day I hack all around the stack and--because I apparently can't get enough--by night I juggle a bunch of services on a bunch of linux distros. I also make and remake a bunch of different sites, like this one, because CMS's are all meh and we just pretend they're stable and good for clients.

Here is a stock photo that came with this template.
