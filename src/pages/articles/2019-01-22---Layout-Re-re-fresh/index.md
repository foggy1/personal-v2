I'll save myself the agita of posting what the site currently looks like on mobile at the time of me writing this, but I'll give you a hint: in purging several horizontal padding guidelines because of the previous sidebar layout, I made it so that the site had no horizontal padding anywhere ever at sub-685px.

...

Whoops!

I made the changes just before heading on a mini roadtrip for the weekend up to [Solvang](https://www.solvangusa.com/) where I inexplicably saw Snoop Dogg while sitting in a fake windmill tasting wine.

If you've never been, I can't guarantee a Snoop Dogg sighting, but the Sausage Garden is pretty dope and, if you're OK with plunking down 20 bucks for a plate, the Solvang Brewing Company has surprisingly good schnitzel. I can also recommend any of the bakeries I tried in town and Paula's Pancake House that does thin, crepe-esque Danish pancakes and might have one of the better cups of coffee I've had at a breakfast joint.

I can also recommend not gutting stylesheets without checking responsiveness before heading out the door without a computer for several days. Totally worth it, though.
