Yeah, yeah.

I keep making new blogs for everything. I've had 3 comics blogs, at least 2 professional blogs, and a slate of other side projects that I swear at any given time will be sticking around.

After nearly 2 years of doing this full-time and more than that just hacking around, I've come to realize it's not just me:

It's tech debt.

Seriously!

I always get excited about new things and rush to try them out. And the shiny makes whatever I'm working on lose its luster (at least in terms of my ephemeral personal stuff, not so much with the stable work/client stuff). By the time I rush after the thing in alpha, when I go to work on it later, I'm saddled with tech debt at the same time that the New Hotness has rolled around.

So, I don't feel so bad.

How active will I be here? I don't know. I write a ton but it's mostly personal or for publication elsewhere.

Anyway, Gatsby v2 is here, so that's cool, but I also want to start messing around with other kinds of solutions and would also just like for once to have a more convenient static site generator with no JavaScript.

But since this blog is at least professional-adjacent, I'm going to pretend I didn't say that! I know ES6! I know Node!

I have `rm -rf node_modules && pray && love` tattooed over my heart!

...

Ok bye.
